Analyzed UFC fight data (1993â€“2021) from Kaggle to develop predictive models for fight outcomes. Extended and improved upon prior work by Kaggle user Conall by exploring additional features, evaluating previously unconsidered factors, and implementing new machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks). Achieved improved prediction accuracy through feature engineering and model optimization, contributing novel insights into fight dynamics and win probabilities
